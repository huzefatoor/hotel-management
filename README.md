# Hotel-Management 
Unfinished hotel website as a personal practice project. 

Used: React, Sanity.io

What I learned:

- Implement Sanity.io commands into terminal.
- Make different components in React using TypeScript.


What I would do if I return to this project:

- Learn Next.js and Stripe.
- Master Sanity.IO properly.
- More practice in backend development.
