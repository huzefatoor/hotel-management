# hotel-management (Landing page, Sign-up page)
Unfinished hotel website as a personal practice project. 

Used: React, Sanity.io, Tailwind

What I learned:
Through this project I learned how to use Sanity.IO, and Tailwind CSS. I also learned how to make different components in React using TypeScript.


What I would do if I return to this project:
If I came back to this project I would have to learn Next.js, and Stripe. I would also have to learn how to use Sanity.IO properly. I would also need more practice wiht backend development.
